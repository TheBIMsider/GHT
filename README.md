# üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Golf Handicap Tracker

A simple, web-based golf handicap calculator that helps golfers track their rounds and calculate their USGA Handicap Index. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages with data storage via Google Sheets.

> **üìã Demo Notice**: This live demo uses dummy golf data for demonstration purposes. To track your own golf rounds, fork this repository and follow the setup instructions below to connect your own Google Sheets.

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Development

This project was created as a "vibe coding" session using **Claude Sonnet 4** AI assistance, with human guidance and golf expertise provided by **Carl Storms** aka ["The BIMsider"](https://bio.link/thebimsider). Carl's unfortunately high golf scores serve as the "dummy data" in the demo - though we assure you, those scores are very real! üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ≥

*A collaboration between human creativity and AI efficiency - proving that even bad golfers can build good apps (and that maybe Carl is the real dummy here, at least where golf scores are concerned, not the data).*

## ‚ú® Features

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Add Rounds**: Enter your golf round details including date, course, score, par, course rating, and slope
2. **Automatic Calculations**: The app calculates score differentials and converts 9-hole rounds to 18-hole equivalents
3. **Dual USGA Handicaps**: Uses official USGA method to calculate both "All Courses" and "Regulation Only" handicap indexes
4. **Separate Statistics**: Track performance across all course types or focus on regulation courses only
5. **Data Persistence**: All data is automatically saved to Google Sheets and synced across devices

### Handicap Calculation Method

The app follows official USGA guidelines and provides **two separate handicap calculations**:

**All Courses Handicap:**
- Includes all course types (regulation, executive, par-3, practice rounds)
- Uses rounds marked as "Include in Handicap"
- Perfect for tracking overall playing ability

**Regulation Courses Only Handicap:**
- Only includes regulation course rounds marked as "Include in Handicap"
- Follows the same USGA calculation method
- Ideal for official handicap tracking and tournament play

**Calculation Rules for Both:**
- Uses the best differentials from your rounds (not just recent scores)
- 20+ rounds: Uses best 8 differentials
- 10-19 rounds: Uses best 40% of differentials  
- 5-9 rounds: Uses best 30% of differentials
- Less than 5 rounds: Uses best 1 differential
- Applies the 96% factor as per USGA rules

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Set up Google Sheets storage**:
   - Go to [SheetDB.io](https://sheetdb.io/) and create a free account
   - Create a new Google Sheet with these column headers:
     ```
     id | date | course | courseType | includeInHandicap | holes | score | par | adjScore | rating | slope | differential
     ```
   - Connect your sheet to SheetDB and get your API URL
3. **Update the API URL** in `script.js` (line ~32):
   ```javascript
   const SHEETDB_API_URL = 'YOUR_SHEETDB_API_URL_HERE';
   ```
4. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch" ‚Üí main branch
   - Your app will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/golf-handicap-tracker`

### Option 2: Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/golf-handicap-tracker.git
   cd golf-handicap-tracker
   ```

2. Set up SheetDB (same as above)

3. Update the API URL in `script.js`

4. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   ```

### üìã Important Notes

- **Demo Data**: The live demo uses dummy golf data. Your forked version will be empty until you add your own rounds.
- **Free SheetDB Limits**: Free accounts have monthly API call limits. For heavy usage, consider upgrading your SheetDB plan.
- **Data Privacy**: Once you set up your own SheetDB connection, your golf data is private and stored in your own Google Sheet.

## üìä Google Sheets Setup

Your Google Sheet should have these columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| id | Unique identifier | 1672531200000 |
| date | Date played | 2024-01-15 |
| course | Course name | Pebble Beach |
| courseType | Type of course | regulation |
| includeInHandicap | Include in handicap | true |
| holes | Holes played | 18 |
| score | Your score | 85 |
| par | Course par | 72 |
| adjScore | 18-hole equivalent | 85 |
| rating | Course rating | 73.2 |
| slope | Slope rating | 131 |
| differential | Calculated differential | 10.4 |

## üéØ Usage Tips

- **Course Rating & Slope**: Find these on the course scorecard or website - they're essential for accurate handicap calculation
- **9-Hole Rounds**: Enter the actual 9-hole score and par; the app automatically doubles them for handicap purposes
- **Course Types**: 
  - Use "Regulation" for standard 18-hole courses (counts toward both handicaps)
  - Use "Executive" for shorter courses (counts only toward All Courses handicap)
  - Use "Practice" for casual rounds you don't want in either handicap
- **Dual Handicap System**: 
  - "All Courses" includes every round type for overall performance tracking
  - "Regulation Only" provides your official handicap for tournament play
- **Sorting**: Click any column header in the Round History table to sort your data - click again to reverse the order
- **Visual Sort Indicators**: Look for ‚Üë‚Üì arrows in column headers to see which column is currently sorted
- **Data Backup**: Your data is automatically saved to Google Sheets, providing cloud backup and sync across devices

## üîß Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
  --primary-green: #2c5530;
  --secondary-green: #4a7c59;
  --light-green: #e8f5e8;
}
```

### Adding New Statistics
Add calculations in the `updateStats()` function in `script.js`.

### Modifying Handicap Calculation
Edit the `calculateHandicap()` function to implement different handicap systems.

## üìÅ File Structure

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Data not saving?**
- Check that your SheetDB API URL is correct in `script.js`
- Verify your Google Sheet has the correct column headers
- Check browser console for error messages

**Handicap calculation seems wrong?**
